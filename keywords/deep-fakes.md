## Deepfakes

Deepfakes are realistic manipulations of video, audio and images using deep learning, specifically Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to swap faces, mimic voices and create entirely fabricated events [^farid2022]. While CGI has been used in films for a long time, deepfakes are different because they do not require Hollywood budgets or specialized training. With the right tools, nearly anyone can generate a convincing fake [^kietzmann2020]. The term “deepfake” comes from a Reddit user who, in 2017, started sharing face-swapped celebrity adult content. What made this particularly alarming was that the user also released the code, allowing others to replicate and refine the technology [^kietzmann2020]. Since then, deepfake capabilities have evolved significantly. One of the first viral examples was "Synthesizing Obama," a 2017 project that used AI to perfectly mimic Barack Obama’s speech and facial movements, making him appear to say things he never actually did [^kietzmann2020]. At the core of deepfake technology is the GAN, first introduced by Ian Goodfellow in 2014. These networks operate through a competitive process: one AI (the generator) creates fake media, while another AI (the discriminator) tries to detect it. As they continuously challenge each other, the generator improves and produces convincing results [^farid2022]. 

Deepfakes are not inherently harmful. In entertainment, they have been used for digital concerts, such as the virtual ABBA performance featuring AI-generated younger versions of the band [^fernandez2024]. Filmmakers have also used similar technology to de-age actors or recreate deceased performers [^fernandez2024]. AI-generated digital doubles have even been explored for virtual assistants and online interactions [^fernandez2024]. 

However, the technology is more often associated with harmful applications. Manipulated media is widely used for disinformation, political propaganda, identity theft and non-consensual explicit content [^farid2022]. In today’s “post-truth” era, where fake news spreads rapidly, deepfakes amplify the challenge of distinguishing fact from fiction [^fernandez2024]. The technology has been weaponized in political attack ads, misinformation campaigns and fabricated speeches designed to manipulate public opinion [^farid2022]. Given how convincing these fakes have become, they pose a serious threat to journalism, democracy, and personal security [^fernandez2024].
