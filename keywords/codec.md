## Codec

A Codec stands for coder/decoder. Its job is to compress and/or decompress files like video or audio.[^microsoft] 
Common codecs we use in our everyday lives are the MPEG series so [MP3](../main/glossary.md#mp3), MP4, as well as Quicktime 
(for Apple users out there).[^internetManagement]Codecs have been developed by multiple different companies and groups 
and they continue to be looked into to create more efficient ways of compressing large files.[^briefHistory] 
Codecs facilitate sharing of larger files as the compressed version is much easier to upload and download.

The invention of codecs influenced the web and the way we can share video and audio through the
Internet. Downloading an uncompressed video can take lots of time and energy so with codecs in 
the picture, large video files are able to be shared with less time spent on downloading. It 
also serves to make the Internet more accessible as people with bad connections are still able 
to access the videos. While an uncompressed video file might take hours to download, with codecs, 
that time becomes much shorter. [^internetManagement]

Since codecs improved accessibility for video and audio files, designers are more likely to 
choose those formats for their websites and other works. For example, rather than having a long 
list of instructions to explain how to build or fix a certain product, a video might be more 
efficient and provide much more precise information than words can.[^internetManagement]
Additionally, codecs make 
video and audio more shareable which encourages artists to delve into that medium and share 
their works online.
