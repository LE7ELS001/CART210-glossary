## Computer Vision

Computer vision (CV) is a subfield of AI research concerned with equipping computers with the ability to mimick human vision  (and, by extension, human visual processing capabilities). There exists many different types of visual data, such as live camera feeds, still images or videos, that can be used as inputs for CV. These inputs are processed by using various models and enable a computer to analyze and recognize what exactly is going on in an image or a sequence of images.

Implementations of Computer Vision are primarily based on deep learning, a collection of techniques which allow computational models (like neural networks) to learn from and understand the patterns that exist within visual data[^comp]. As a general rule, large amounts of data (identified using labels) must be fed to these models[^comp][^ibm]. 

One of the most widely used deep learning techniques used in CV is Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Inspired by models of the human visual system, CNNs consists of three types of neural layers: convolutional layers, pooling layers and fully connected layers[^comp]. Convolutional layers use various small matrices called kernels to perform convolutions on the input data and generate feature maps. These feature maps can be described as 2D mappings of the different features an image might possess. Different kernels allow for the extraction of different features. Pooling layers are characterized by their ability to reduce the dimensions of the input data (also called downsampling) for subsequent layers: doing so reduces computing overhead but results in information loss[^comp]. Fully Connected layers have neurons that are connected to every other activation in the previous layer and perform the high level reasoning in the network[^comp]. 

A CNN begins by discerning simple shapes and edges before iterating and recognizing more complex elements[^ibm]. Enventually, utilizing these models, CV systems can perform multiple tasks, such as object detection (or semantic segmentation) [^ibm][^comp], facial recognition[^comp], or object tracking [^ibm].
Real-world applications of these basic capabilities include the development of self-driving cars or translation by pointing a camera at a piece of written text [^ibm]. 

In the field of contemporary art and media studies, Computer Vision can provide a new language, based in mathematical/numerical features, with which to analyze cultural artifacts[^mano]. For example, every minute hue shift in a video could be translated into a collection of very precise datapoints which could then be processed and stored. Similarly, CV allows us to adequately analyze the massive amounts of visual information created and shared everyday on social networks and the Internet in general[^mano].  In other words, Computer Vision can allow us to apprehend and comprehend our own rapidly evolving, ever-expanding visual cultures. 

However, some new media artists question Computer Vision and its ties with our modern technological societies' propensities for ubiquitous surveillance. In the early 2010s, artist and researcher Adam Harvey worked on CV Dazzle, an art project which sought camouflage human faces from computers by using design and fashion[^harv]. Harvey used bold and unconventional combinations of makeup, accessories and hair styling to break apart the facial features used in CV to recognize faces[^harv]. While these patterns do not work on current, more advanced Computer Vision systems, CV dazzle gives us insight into how we might go about creatively resisting the normalization of facial recognition.
