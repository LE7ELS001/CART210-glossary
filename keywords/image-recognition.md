## Image Recognition 

Image recognition is a part of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision. It’s goal is to focus on identifying objects, patterns, spaces or scenes in images to further categorize them. These image recognition technologies are used in security, e-commerce, smart vehicles and healthcare. For the technologies to be successful in what it does it must rely on deep learning (DL), especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Because of DL and CNN, image recognition models have greatly improved in terms of efficiency and accuracy. [^krizhevsky17imagenet]

There are multiple steps in the process of image recognition for a machine to recognize and categorize images.
1.	Collection & Preprocessing of data: Large datasets such as ImageNet or Coco are used for training and testing machine learning models. In order to improve recognition accuracy, preprocessing techniques such as image normalization, noise reduction, and resizing are put into use. [^rawat17deep]
2.	Extraction: Unlike traditional methods where image recognition would rely on handcrafted features, deep learning automatically learns from raw data. This data could be the edges, textures, or shapes of an object in order to distinguish them from others.[^rawat17deep]
3.	Model training: CNNs learn from labeled images to recognize different objects more accurately. [^he16residual]
4.	Classification: Once the model is trained, it is ready to analyze new images to extract and classify them in categories.[^krizhevsky17imagenet]
Deep Learning in Image Recognition
Deep learning, particularly CNNs, have pushed image recognition higher than ever, surpassing traditional learning machines. CNNs automatically learns patterns from digital images to improve accuracy [^rawat17deep]. One of the key models was AlexNet (2012) which demonstrates the effectiveness of CNNs in large-scale image classification. [^krizhevsky17imagenet]



Image recognition is becoming more and more used in our everyday wordd.
1.	Facial recognition & security
Facial recognition is used to verify identities, detecting facial features in realtime to provide security and privacy. These features can be found in smartphones, surveillance cameras, or various authentication process [^rawat17deep].
2.	Medical & healthcare
Image recognition is also used in healthcare (X-rays, MRIs and CT scans) to help in the diagnosis of diseases. Deep learning-based models have become more and more advanced allowing it to have high accuracy in determining skin cancer and other conditions through images. [^he16residual] 
3.	Smart Vehicles 
Self-driving cars uses image recognition to detect any incoming elements. Pedestrians, traffic signals, lane markers, stops signs and obstacles such as bumps are all detected by these smart vehicles. The KITTI dataset is commonly used to train deep learning models for self-driving.[^krizhevsky17imagenet]


Although image recognition has proven useful, it also provides a couple of new challenges. One of them is about ethical concerns. Image recognition could sometime provide inaccurate predictions through biases from datasets. These inaccuracies are mostly evident in facial recognition and medical diagnosis [^rawat17deep].
