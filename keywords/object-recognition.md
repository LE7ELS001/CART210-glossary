## Object recognition

Object recognition is a subgenre of computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI) that allows machines to analyse, identify and classify objects through various media types such as images or videos. The process relies on deep learning models such as CNNs, convolutional neural networks, to detect objects with high accuracy [^Zhao2019]. Object recognition is regularly used in autonomous vehicules, security systems, and medical machines. [^Jiao2019] 


1-	Image Preprocessing: To improve the quality of the image, it will be using techniques such as noise reduction, contrast adjustments and resizing. [^Jiao2019]
2-	Extraction: Once it locks on an object, the system then identifies the unique features of the objects such as edges, textures and shapes to classify. [^Zhao2019]
3-	Model Training: Deep learning models such as YOLO or Faster R-CNN are trained using large datasets (COCO or ImageNet) in order to recognize object patterns. [^Liu2019]
4-	Detection and classification: The trained model takes in the new images, processes them by detecting the object then assigning them into categoris based on probability-based classification techniques. [^Zhao2019]


Many industries rely on object recognition. Autonomous vehicles for example would not exist without the implementation of object recognition. Slef-driving cars rely on object recognition to detect pedestrians, road signs, blockades and other vehicles in real-time. [^Zhao2019] Same goes for medical imaging. The technologies used in the medical field rely on object recognition to spot tumors, fractures and many more problems through X-Rays, MRIs and CT scans. [^Jiao2019] Surveillance systems uses facial and object recognition to enhance security. [^Jiao2019]
