## Surveillance Capitalism
Surveillance capitalism is an economic model that emerged with the rise of big tech companies. Coined by Shoshana Zuboff, the term describes an economic system in which personal data is extracted and sold to influence human behaviour [^zuboff2023]. Unlike traditional capitalism, which transforms natural resources into commodities, surveillance capitalism commodifies the human experience itself. It turns behavioural data into a product for profit [^zuboff2023].

### History
Surveillance capitalism began in the early 2000s, largely driven by Google. Initially, Google collected user search data to refine its search algorithms. However, following the 2001 dot-com bust, the company faced pressure to generate revenue and realized that user data had untapped economic value [^zuboff2019]. Googleâ€™s breakthrough came when it started using behavioural surplus to create prediction products for targeted advertising. This marked a turning point, transforming Google from a search engine into a data business [^zuboff2019].

Zuboff also ties the expansion of surveillance capitalism to post-9/11 mass surveillance policies. Laws like the U.S. Patriot Act encouraged data collection, creating an environment where companies like Google could expand their data extraction practices with no oversight [^techtarget]. This development set the stage for the rise of big tech giants like Facebook, Amazon, and Apple to adopt data-driven business models [^techtarget].

### Digital Culture
Surveillance capitalism is deeply ingrained into modern digital infrastructure. While it relies on technologies such as machine learning, sensors, and data analytics, it is not the technology itself but the economic model behind it that defines its impact [^zuboff2019]. In this system, companies do not simply use data to enhance user experiences but rather to manufacture prediction products that advertisers and other clients purchase [^zuboff2019]. The model has expanded beyond advertising, affecting industries such as finance, healthcare, and even government [^zuboff2019].

One of the defining aspects of surveillance capitalism is the role of humans in it. Users are not customers but rather raw material for data extraction. Unlike a traditional market transaction, where consumers have choice and agency, surveillance capitalism operates without user consent or awareness [^zuboff2023]. The process is designed to keep individuals unaware of the extent of data collection and manipulation [^techtarget].

The influence of surveillance capitalism extends beyond targeted ads as it affects privacy, autonomy, and democracy. By continuously tracking user behaviour, companies not only predict but also shape human actions. They influence political opinions, consumer behaviour, and social interactions [^techtarget].

Additionally, surveillance capitalism normalizes a world where privacy is no longer a given. The increasing integration of smart devices, IoT technology, and AI-driven systems means that more aspects of human life are being recorded and monetized [^techtarget]. According to Zuboff, this shift risks our fundamental rights, as people lose control over their digital lives [^techtarget]. Understanding and addressing surveillance capitalism is essential for shaping a more ethical digital future.
