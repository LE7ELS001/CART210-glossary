## Immersion

Immersion is a key concept in new media and interactive experiences. It refers to the sensation of a person being enveloped in a digital space or virtual environment. It is often described as the user's presence in a mediated space, frequently observed in virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and interactive storytelling.


The concept of immersion can be traced back to early forms of media. Specifically, 19th-century devices such as the **Panorama** and **Peep Show** aimed to modernize passive spectatorship by engaging audiences with vast visual spectacles in controlled environments. According to Jonathan Crary's analysis: "It is a new isolated consumer of a mass-produced commodity"[^ebersbach01immersion]. 
Crary argues that it is valuable to emphasize the continuity between immersive experiences today and those from 150 years agoo[^ebersbach01immersion]. 
Thanks to the ealier devices of the sens fo depth and realism, it had evolve to the development of VR headset, haptic feedback systems and spatial audio.

An early theory discussion by Janet Murray describe it as the experience of being transported into a digital narritve[^ebersbach02immersion]. Later, Mel Slater and Sylvia Wilbur distinguished betweem i,mersion and precence as the subjective feeling of bneing "inside" a virtual world[^ebersbach03immersion].

### How is it holding in Media Practices

Immersion plays a central role in contemporary digital life in everything from video games and virtual reality simulation to interactive theater and narrative mediated by artificial intelligence. Immersive experience in video games is achieved through fidelity-rich visuals, physics engines that react to players' actions, and diegetic sound. Immersive installations in film and digital art rely on 360-degree projection, spatial audio, and interactive elements that react to movement.
In human-computer interaction, immersion is typically synonymous with flow theory of Csikszentmihalyi[^ebersbach04immersion] in that users are completely absorbed in an experience since it is so well designed and so captivating.
