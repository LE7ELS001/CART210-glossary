## Pinch, zoom, and swipe



**1983**: Myron Kruger pioneered a form of pinch-to-zoom using suspended cameras and computers, not touchscreens [^mallery].\
**1991**: Pierre Wellner demonstrated the pinch gesture with hanging video cameras in his Digital Desk at Rank Xerox EuroPARC [^mallery].\
**1991**: Dean Rubine at Carnegie Mellon University developed a custom multi-touch system and named the pinch gesture "rotate-scale-translate" [^mallery].\
**1992**: The "Starfire" short film by Sun Microsystems featured the pinch gesture in a futuristic "Sun Video Collaboration Booth" [^mallery].\
**1998**: John Elias and Wayne Westerman founded Fingerworks, creating touchpads that led to Apple's iGesturePad after acquisition in 2005 [^mallery].\
**1998**: Touch-sensitive sensors appeared in Moog musical instruments, and the Lemur, the first screen-based multi-touch product, was developed [^mallery].\
**2004**: Neonode, a Swedish phone manufacturer, patented the Swipe function three years before Apple [^mick].\
**2006**: Jeff Han, a research scientist from NYU, was a key developer of the pinch-to-zoom feature [^mallery].\
**2007**: Steve Jobs demonstrated the pinch-to-zoom feature on the iPhone [^mallery].\
**2010**: The pinch-to-zoom technology was implemented in Android products [^mallery].

### Functions

There are various ways to use the pinch-to-zoom function on iPhones and Android multi-touch devices. First, we see the two-finger pinch which usually requires two hands, making it difficult for users on the go [^garg]. There are different ways to accomplish this, either by holding the phone with one hand and pinching with the other, supporting the device with both hands and using both thumbs to navigate the pinch-to-zoom function, or to hold the phone with one hand and using the thumb and index to complete this action [^garg]. Interactions such as the double-tap gesture enables users to quickly zoom in and out, but does not provide a direct zoom into the desired area of the screen and must be repositioned manually [^garg]. The swipe function enables users to quickly switch between pages, images or profiles, reacting much faster than using the drag function [^jeong]. 

New one-handed alternatives have been implemented to introduce additional gestures to control this function. VolumeZoom is a touchless function utilizing the volume-up key to zoom in, while volume-down zooms out [^garg]. GyroZoom uses devices’ real-time gyroscope sensor to activate the function, tilting the phone clockwise lets users zoom in, while anti-clockwise zooms out, using the angle of rotation to control the amount of zoom applied [^garg]. In 2014, designers developed an enhanced zooming technique called Pinch-To-Zoom-Plus (PZP), a method that helps reduce clutching during panning operations [^avery]. This function was developed based on research showing that zooming followed a predictable ballistic velocity curve, demonstrating that users have a tendency to pinch the center of the screen [^avery]. Additional research showed that tap-and-drag was favored to pinch-to-zoom, being quicker and more efficient based on the number of gestures involved [^farhad]. Furthermore, a team working at the Institut fur Informatik in Germany explored using the spiral gesture as a zooming mechanism, tracing inwards to zoom in and vice versa [^artinger].
