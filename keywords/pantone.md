## Pantone

In 1963, Lawrence Herbert created the Pantone Matching System. Working for a commercial printing company 
named Pantone, he came up with a way to make colours more accurate in printing.[^KiernanPottedHistory] By having specific names 
and codes for each colour, artists and designers could choose the specific colour they wanted and have it stay 
consistent across their work.

The way Pantone colours work also increases the quality of print. Instead of using CMYK to create different 
colours, Pantone mixes the ink and has the colour ready. With CMYK printing, it’s typically an overlay of small 
dots crossing over each other to create the wanted colour. However, with Pantone colours, there aren’t those 
small dots, the colour can be printed evenly everywhere, making designs look more crisp. Additionally, Pantone 
provides a wide variety of colours, some of which are impossible to create with CMYK. For example, there are 
fluorescent or metallic inks.[^wageningen]

 In the 1980s Pantone was integrated into a variety of different software to help creators have more accurate
 colour-picking options. Companies such as Xerox Corporation, Adobe Systems Inc. and Canon Inc. implemented 
 the colours so work on screen could translate more effectively to physical mediums.[^pantoneWebsite] 


The Pantone Matching System doesn’t just affect printing on paper but is also used for all types of colour 
work. Pantone colours can be used in textiles, plastics, coatings and paints. Because of the accurate 
colour matching across multiple mediums, branding using colour was simplified. Companies and products could 
claim a specific Pantone colour and use it across their branding, making them more recognizable to consumers. 
Examples of such branding can be seen in Coca Cola red, Barbie pink and even countries have chosen 
specific Pantone colours for their flags. [^davisHistoryPantone]
