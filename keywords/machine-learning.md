## Machine Learning

Machine Learning, also known as ML, is a field of study in artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from and make decisions based on data, without explicitly being programmed for each task. [^wikipedia] Overtime as the computer is exposed to more data, it’s able to learn from experience and improve upon its own performance, simulating human-like intelligent behaviour. [^mitsloan]

To train a Machine Learning system, data is gathered and provided to the system as training data. Programmers allow for the system to analyze the data and train itself by recognizing patterns and forming predictions. Programmers can also later tweak the system's parameters or test the system using new data to help push the model towards more accurate results. [^mitsloan]

There are three primary types of machine learning:

- Supervised Learning: The most common type of modern machine learning, Supervised Learning incorporates labeled datasets. This allows for the model to search for specifically sought after patterns. [^mitsloan] Supervised Learning uses example input-output pairs to train the model and uses two sets of data, training data and testing data, which creates a workflow that ensures more accurate results. [^mahesh]

- Unsupervised Learning: Unsupervised Learning is used to locate patterns we aren’t specifically looking for. [^mitsloan] There is no correct answer as to what models trained with Unsupervised Learning may find, the model is left to its own devices to recognize patterns and structure within the given data. [^mahesh]

- Reinforcement Learning: Reinforcement Learning uses a trial and error approach combined with a reward system to train the model in recognizing patterns and guide it towards better decision-making. [^mitsloan]

Machine learning has become integral to new media, influencing how content is created, distributed, and consumed. From the algorithms social media uses to curate a personalized feed, to AI chatbots like ChatGPT that are dominating the online world, Machine Learning is a core part of modern technology. [^duggal]
