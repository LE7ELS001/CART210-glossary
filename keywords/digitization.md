## Digitization

Digitization describes the conversion of data, physical, analog, into a digital form.[^oxfor10dictionary] The process brings with it discussions on the positive and negative sides of this conversion, particularly when it comes to the preservation and accessibility of data, both from a creator and consumer perspective.
	
From a creator perspective, this shift disrupts “a number of copyright-protected media industries, including books, music, radio, television, and movies.” Because  “once information is transformed into digital form, it can be copied and distributed at near-zero marginal costs.” (Waldfogel 195) Not only is copyright infringement an issue, as in the unwanted distribution of an artist’s material, but it becomes an issue of income as well due to the fact that “digitization  has threatened the traditional revenue sources of some of these media industries.”[^waldfogel17golden]

Interestingly, the digitization of analog media has allowed for more seemingly positive outcomes for consumers. Due to the aforementioned widespread distribution, media is more easily reachable for those with access to digital versions, especially the internet. It reshuffles the mix of public and private.[^greenstein13digitization] As well, discussions around digitization often center around the preservation of media, for which it is applied in the case of museums and other such archives, both as backup for the physical version and contributing to its accessibility if made available online.

However, Paul Conway in his article Preservation in the Age of Google presents an interesting perspective on the consumer end of this digital era of information. He explains that there are two sources which convey the feeling of a flood of digitized information; “[It feels as if] we are indeed immersed in an all-digital environment. One source is the collectively massive and accelerating conversion of book and nonbook materials from analog to digital form. The second source derives from the fact that nearly all new information is created digitally, communicated digitally, used in a digital environment, and stored in digital systems, sometimes ‘for posterity.’”[^conway10preservation]

The process of copying analog information into digital versions of itself seems straightforward and logical given the capabilities of archiving that comes with modern technologies. Yet although it does have many advantages, it is important to consider how this new way of distributing information fundamentally changes the way that media is accessed and received, with these changes being felt on both the creator and consumer end.
