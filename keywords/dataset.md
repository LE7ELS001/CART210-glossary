## Dataset 

A Dataset is a structured collection of data, typically organized in a tabular form where each column represents a specific variable, 
and each row corresponds to an individual record. This organization facilitates efficient data management, analysis, 
and retrieval across various disciplines. “Even the term dataset is problematic, referring to at least four common themes—grouping, 
content, relatedness, and purpose—each of which has multiple categories” [^borgman15bigdata]. 

A dataset is an organized compilation of interconnected information sets, consisting of distinct elements that,
despite being separate, it can be processed and managed collectively by a computer as a single entity. 
These information sets are data “In rhetorical terms, data are that which exists prior to argument or interpretation 
that converts them to facts, evidence and information” [^kitchin14revolution] in the Book “The Data Revolution: ...” 
they defined data as the basic,  input used to represent aspects of the world by organizing them into categories,
measurements and other representational forms. These forms can include numerical values, text, images, sounds, and digital signals, 
which are the foundation for producing meaningful information and knowledge.[^kitchin14revolution]

There are different types of datasets as these datasets can be categorized by the type of data they contain or by the relationship
between the variables of data. These classifications can be categorical, correlation, bivariate, multivariate and structured. 
These classifications are affected by the various types of data “such as relational data (structured data), text (unstructured data),
semi-structured data (like XML or JSON), and streaming data from sources like sensors or social media.” [^russom13managing]. 

Depending on the use of the dataset or its size and complexity can affect how it is managed. Datasets that are very large and complex
are difficult to manage and analyze using traditional data processing tools. This can be defined as Big Data which are datasets
of multiple terabytes or larger as it contains “a wide range of data types (relational, text, multi-structured data, etc.) 
from numerous sources, including relatively new ones (Web applications, machines, sensors, and social media)”[^russom13managing].
Datasets can vary in size from just a few bits to several terabytes and can function as standalone entities. 
The suitable unit of measurement is determined by the specific purpose for which the dataset is being used 
“In addition, digital datasets can be opened only with certain software, whether statistical tools, instrument-specific code,
or software suited to applications in the domain” [^borgman15bigdata].
