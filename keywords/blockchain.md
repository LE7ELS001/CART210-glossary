## Blockchain

Blockchain is known for its role in cryptocurrency systems where it maintains a secure and decentralized record of transactions. 
Blockchain “(a.k.a. distributed ledger technology) enables the secure transfer of money, assets, and information via the Internet 
without the need for a third-party intermediary”. [^swan17philosophy] It enables peer-to-peer transactions without the need 
for intermediaries, ensuring transparency and immutability.“the digital ledger software underlying cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, 
for the secure transfer of money, assets, and information via the Internet”[^swan17philosophy].

Beyond its role as a digital payment system designed specifically for the Internet, “the underlying blockchain technology is touted 
as a way to store and transact everything from property records to certificates for art and jewelry” [^narayanan16research]. 
This means that blockchain's potential extends far beyond cryptocurrency, offering a decentralized and secure method for verifying ownership
and authenticity across various industries. An example of what Blockchain can used for is as a digital registry “ to record, transfer,
and verify asset ownership (home, auto, stocks, bonds, mortgages, and insurance)” [^swan17philosophy]. It can also preserve the authenticity 
of sensitive documents and records “(such as passports, visas, driver's licenses, birth and death certificates, voter registration, contracts,
wills, patents, and medical records)” [^swan17philosophy].

One of blockchain’s key advantages is that it is “distributed: It runs on computers provided by volunteers around the world, 
so there is no central database to hack” [^tapscott16blockchain]. Additionally, it is “public: Anyone can view it at any time because
it resides on the network” [^tapscott16blockchain], ensuring transparency by allowing anyone to access and verify transactions.
At the same time, it is “encrypted: It uses heavy-duty encryption to maintain security” [^tapscott16blockchain], 
which helps protect data and build trust in the system. By eliminating intermediaries and creating tamper-resistant records,
blockchain technology enhances transparency, reduces fraud, and streamlines transactions in areas such as real estate, 
supply chain management, and digital identity verification.
