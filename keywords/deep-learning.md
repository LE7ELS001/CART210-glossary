## Deep Learning

Deep learning can be defined as an advanced form of machine learning. These algorithms usually operate by taking information in and pushing out an output after processing. The Deep Learning process instead involves multiple algorithms of processing information that communicate with each other to analyze data.[^jo23foundations]

This process creates a computer that can learn from experience independently. It learns complex concepts by building from simpler ones. These layers of understanding create hierarchies many layers deep.[^goodfellow16learning]

These artificial neural networks are inspired by the design of the human brain. Each node of this network is responsible for learning different parts of the data. They can solve many different kinds of problems from image recognition to language processing. It is the latest frontier for AI and complex machines. Deep learning is still held back by large data requirements, cannot distinguish good from bad data well and be biased due to the data it is given.[^google25whatis]

With machines taking a step closer to human intelligence, their existence makes us question our own understanding of intelligence and human identity. Learning and understanding was once only thought to be a natural trait of man. Now we must face the reality of machines that may catch up to our intellect.
