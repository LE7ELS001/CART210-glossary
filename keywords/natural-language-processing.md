## Natural Language Processing (NLP)


Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language.[^NLPIBM] It involves developing algorithms and models that enable computers to interpret, analyze, and generate human language in a way that is both meaningful and contextually relevant. By leveraging techniques from computational linguistics and machine learning, NLP facilitates tasks such as text classification, language translation, sentiment analysis, and conversational agent development.

The field of NLP has undergone significant evolution over the past decades. Early approaches were largely rule-based, relying on hand-crafted linguistic rules to process language.[^speechandlanguageprocessing] Over time, statistical methods were introduced, which paved the way for more scalable approaches. In recent years, the emergence of deep learning—especially transformer-based architectures like BERT has revolutionized NLP by enabling models to capture nuanced contextual information in language data.[^bert]

Applications of NLP span a wide range of areas. For instance, machine translation systems like Google Translate use deep [neural networks](../main/glossary.md#neural-networks) to improve language translation, making it more accurate. Virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa rely on NLP to understand and respond naturally to spoken language. In business, sentiment analysis tools process text from social media, reviews, and surveys to extract insights on public opinion and consumer sentiment.[^speechandlanguageprocessing] Most recently, generative AI chatbots are one of the most significant advancements in NLP, as they act as a culimnation of decades of research and development into computational linguistics.
