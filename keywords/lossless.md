## Lossless
Lossless compression offers a method to reduce file sizes without compromising any of the original content. 
For text, music, images, or videos, the principle remains consistent: minimize file size while preserving all details.
With images specifically, this compression technique ensures that every aspect of visual quality remains identical to the original. 
Unlike lossy compression, which discards some data to achieve smaller file sizes, lossless compression guarantees complete preservation of the original [^ester90image]. 
Lossless compression is especially valuable when dealing with sensitive or high-quality content, 
such as professional photography or archival data, where even the smallest loss in quality could be detrimental. 
Its ability to maintain the integrity of the original file makes it ideal for tasks that demand accuracy and clarity. 

When preserving moving images, it's important to use methods that keep the original quality intact. 
This means compressing the files without losing any details or clarity. By avoiding any loss of data, 
the digital copies stay true to the original, which is especially important for historical films or valuable content. 
This way, the material remains high-quality and can be easily stored and accessed in the future without worry about
losing quality over time [^besser01digital].

Compression becomes more challenging when dealing with noise, random errors that can appear in any file type. 
These irregularities complicate compression by introducing unnecessary information. 
The Rice algorithm, a lossless data compression method, is good at handling noisy data since it can compress files about 1.4 times better 
and 2-3 times faster than methods like GZIP [^pence09lossless].  Choosing the appropriate compression 
methodology would be able to optimize file size while maintaining quality across all media types.
