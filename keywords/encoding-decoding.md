## Encoding & Decoding

Within information theory and communications, encoding and decoding are complementary processes that manage how data is transformed, transmitted, and finally interpreted across various forms of media [^1]. Within the context of new media in particular, these processes are much more important due to them being, at their base, digital in nature when it comes to content generation, distribution, and consumption [^2].  Encoding involves the conversion of information into a digital format optimized for transmission or storage, while decoding translates that encoded information back into a comprehensible form, the inverse [^3].

Encoding is fundamental in new media as it facilitates the digitization of various content and mediums, including textual, visual, auditory, and video data [^4]. This digitization enables efficient storage, manipulation, and transmission of media across digital networks [^5]. For instance, video encoding algorithms, such as H.264/AVC or H.265/HEVC, compress raw video files by exploiting spatial and temporal redundancies, thus reducing the computational demand for a given task over the internet. Without efficient encoding techniques, bandwidth requirements for transmitting such data would be inconveniently high, rendering real time streaming applications impractical[^6].

On the flip side, decoding represents the process by which digital devices and software applications interpret the already encoded information to render it back into a human usable format. This encompasses displaying images on a screen, reproducing audio through speakers, or rendering text in a readable font as opposed to zeros and ones. The quality of the decoding directly impacts the user experience, as it determines the fidelity and accuracy with which the original information is reconstructed then interpreted [^7].

One example of encoding and decoding in new media is the utilization of the Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) format for digital audio. AAC, standardized as part of the MPEG-4 suite, employs psychoacoustic modeling to selectively discard perceptually irrelevant audio information, hence achieving smaller file sizes compared to older formats like MP3 while maintaining superior audio quality. When an AAC-encoded audio file is played, a decoder reconstructs the audio signal based on the encoded data to make actual sound, enabling users to listen to high-fidelity music on portable devices with limited space and streaming platforms [^8].

Encoding and decoding are intricately linked to contemporary technologies and media practices, including streaming media services, digital broadcasting, and online gaming as they rely on the encoding algorithms to deliver high quality content over limited networks [^9]. The growth of social media platforms and content has further amplified the demand for accessible encoding tools that empower individuals to create and spread their own media, encouraging the development of softwares and mobile apps that streamline the encoding process. Perhaps an easy example would be the ability to encode a video, uploading to Youtube, thus disseminating your own content publicly on the site. 

To finish, encoding and decoding represent foundational processes that support the functionality of new media. They shape our interactions with technology and our participation in digital life. Thus, an understanding of encoding and decoding principles is essential for navigating the intricacies of the digital world.

Prompt example (variations used): “A horizontally split image illustrating the concept of audio encoding and decoding. On the left side, a clean and smooth waveform in blue, representing the original sound. In the center, the waveform becomes distorted, pixelated, or fragmented, symbolizing the encoding process where data is compressed or altered. The distortion includes binary numbers, glitch effects, or pixel breakdowns. On the right side, the waveform is restored to its original smooth form, signifying successful decoding.
