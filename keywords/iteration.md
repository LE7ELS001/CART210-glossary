## Iteration
Iteration refers to the repeated execution of tasks or procedures derived from the Latin word *iteratio*, meaning "repetition".[^etymologyIteration] In design and engineering, it involves the ongoing process of revisiting a set of steps or operations with the intent of refining and improving a product, system, or idea.[^NormanEverydayDesign]
In New media, this practice is essential for fostering continuous development, innovation, and a responsive approach to user needs.

Historically, iteration has been integral to programming and has significant applications in mathematics, engineering, and design.
It became a cornerstone of computer programming in the mid-20th century with the introduction of loops in languages like **FORTRAN** and **ALGOL**, facilitating efficient task repetition crucial for early computational processes.[^johnBackusFotron]

The importance of iterative processes spans various fields, particularly in software development, user experience design, and artificial intelligence. 
Agile methodologies in software development emphasize iterative cycles or sprints, allowing for continuous improvement based on user feedback.[^cohn2006] 
In user experience design, iterative processes are employed to optimize digital interfaces, ensuring they meet diverse user needs.[^NormanEverydayDesign] 
In the field of AI, the iterative training of machine learning models increases accuracy as algorithms learn from more data over time.[^goodfellow2016] 
These methods shape contemporary digital culture, which is evident in social media platforms that encourage creativity through the remixing and adapting of content, fostering collaboration. 
In gaming, iterative design enables developers to refine gameplay and respond to player feedback through updates and new content.[^juul2005] 
Social media algorithms utilize iterative processes to continuously enhance and curate content based on user interactions, significantly influencing the online experience.

Notable examples that highlight the use of iteration include platforms like **TikTok** and **YouTube**, which use iteration to analyze user behavior and refine content recommendations. This ensures user feeds remain engaging, keeping users returning.
In **video games**, iteration is crucial for development. Designers release updates and patches based on player feedback and analytics, improving gameplay, balancing mechanics, and adding features that resonate with the community.
Similarly, software updates on our phones are a prime example of iteration. Companies like **Apple** and **Google** release regular updates to fix bugs, enhance security, and introduce new features, ensuring devices remain functional and up-to-date.
