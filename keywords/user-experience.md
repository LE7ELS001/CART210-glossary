## User Experience (UX)

User Experience (UX) design is crafting digital products or services that provide meaningful and relevant experiences to users. It involves a combination of elements such as usability, accessibility, and pleasure, to improve user satisfaction.[^hamidi23introductionUIUX]  The concept of UX extends beyond the visual appearance of a product. It focuses on the overall experience of interacting with it to consider the full range of user needs, behaviors, and emotions.[^hamidi23introductionUIUX] 

The term "User Experience" was coined by Don Norman in the early 1990s while working at Apple’s Advanced Technology Group.[^hernandez19origins] [^alves14state] As the head of the “User Experience Architect’s Office,” Norman sought to shift the design focus from just usability and interface design to a broader, more holistic view of the entire user experience.[^hernandez19origins] In the years that followed, UX became increasingly central to digital product development as the complexity of human-computer interaction (HCI) grew with the rise of personal computing, mobile apps, and the internet.[^alves14state] 

Related to the new media, UX design is essential to modern technology, especially in websites, mobile applications, and interactive products. With the increasing prevalence of digital devices, UX has become integral to ensuring users can interact with products effortlessly and intuitively.[^orlova16UXdesign] As new technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and virtual reality (VR) continue to evolve, the field of UX design is adapting to meet new challenges.[^hamidi23introductionUIUX] For example, the integration of voice interfaces (e.g., Siri, Alexa) in digital products represents a growing trend in UX design, where voice commands and natural language processing become central to user interactions.[^hamidi23introductionUIUX]

Some of the most recognizable examples of effective UX design can be observed in platforms like Google and Facebook, where user-centric design ensures seamless navigation and engagement. Google's minimalist homepage and Facebook's intuitive user flows highlight how UX design can simplify complex processes and enhance user satisfaction.[^basuki22effects] Similarly, mobile apps like Uber and Airbnb demonstrate how UX design can improve usability by addressing user needs in real-time, creating efficient and enjoyable experiences that increase user retention.[^levy21UXstrategy]
The rise of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) further emphasizes the significance of UX design.[^hamidi23introductionUIUX] In these environments, designers are tasked with creating immersive, interactive experiences that not only engage users but also consider their psychological and physical responses to virtual spaces. These new technologies challenge traditional UX paradigms and provide opportunities for designers to push the boundaries of user interaction.

UX design has significantly influenced contemporary digital culture by shaping how users interact with products and services. Companies like Apple, Google, and Amazon have made exceptional user experiences a cornerstone of their brands,[^hamidi23introductionUIUX] which sets high standards for user expectations. As technology becomes more integrated into daily life, the demand for user-centered, accessible, and engaging experiences continues to grow, which makes UX design a crucial factor in the success of digital products.
