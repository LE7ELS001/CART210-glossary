## Futurism

"Futurism" is an art movement, though it could be argued to be more than that due to its ideals.
This movement was started in Italy around 1909, and was at its most popular from then until some time in the 1920's, thought it is reported to have "ended" around 1944. [^unknown_accessed_2025_artstory]
The creation, and much of the fire behind the movement, is largely attributed to an Italian poet named Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, who published a text titled "Manifesto of Futurism" in 1909, seemingly sparking much of the movement.

Futurism was primarily driven by a dissatisfaction with the nostalgia much of the country held for classical art and history, and identified with speed, efficiency, and promoting chaotic changes in life.  
Many Futurists saw tradition as lifeless and no longer relevant. They believed that classical media only served to keep society chained to outdated ways of thinking. [^filippo_marinetti_1909_manifesto]
Much of this thinking was shown through their dislike of romanticism, with them blaming sentimentality and the glorification of a rural life as the reason for a world feeling stagnant.

Much of this movement was inspired by the Industrial Revolution, which had quickly transformed society with machines, electricity, and new forms of transportation. [^ekin_pinar_2024_speed]
Futurists looked at these creations as a beacon of efficiency and beauty in a world that had lost itself in its past. 
Many of them favored gaining inspiration from environments such as factories and industry.

One of the most controversial view that was / is held by a lot of the Futurist community is that violence and conflict are cleansing forces meant to purify the world.
Think of this view as creating an artificial river from a pond, draining the stagnant water and creating new inspiration for innovation in its wake.
Marinetti referred to war as a form of hygiene, a destruction that was necessary for rebirth of idea and innovation.

### Relation to New Media and Modern Definition

While Futurism itself isn't considered a very popular movement by todays standards, its ideas and reasoning greatly connects to the world we find ourselves in today.
One example is its worship of speed and constant efficiency. Much of todays technology and especially the internet operates through its instantanous responses, with social media, viral trends, and digital content constantly spreading at high speeds.
On the daily, we see trends rise and fall from fame as the chaotic speed that our creations evolve at give more and more for us to see while leaving us less time to do it.

Another idea that clearly mirrors Futuristic ideals is our rejection of the past.
While Futurists of said past might have called classical art and tradition obsolete, the society of today simply disrupts traditional forms of media by digitalizing anything and everything.
Simply put, the internet prioritizes the now over the past.

In an interesting twist of events, the events of the now seem to have some similarities to those seen during the origin of Futurism, with many finding the current world a bore, and tensions build off of the social unrest gathering throughout several large countries.

I would define modern Futurism as a philosophical movement that is characterized by innovation, technology, and chaos, while challenging more traditional values and conventions.
