## Identity Management

Identity management is a system that checks users and controls their access to an organization's resources. In new media, it shows how users create, maintain and protect their online profiles as they navigate digital spaces. These systems govern the processes of identifying, authenticating, and authorizing individuals and determining the level of access they have to various digital resources.[^windley]

The significance of identity management in new media stems from the shift where digital interactions have largely replaced or supplemented physical ones. The term became common in the late 1990s and early 2000s when enterprise networks expanded and the internet became a mainstream platform for commerce, communication, and content delivery. Today, identity management represents the intersection of security, privacy, user experience, and digital rights in networked environments.[^windley]

Identity management matters in new media for several reasons:

* The proliferation of digital services requiring authentication has created a complex ecosystem where users must manage multiple identities across platforms.
* The rise of data analysis through [analytics](#analytics) and [surveillance](#surveillance) has increased the stakes of identity protection and privacy.
* Digital identities have become extensions of personal and professional lives, blurring boundaries between online and offline existence.
* [AI](#ai) systems increasingly rely on identity data to personalize experiences and make decisions affecting users.

Modern identity management is integrated into nearly all digital platforms and technologies. Single sign-on (SSO) solutions allow users to access multiple applications with one set of credentials. Social login capabilities enable users to leverage existing identities from platforms like Google or Facebook across the web, creating interconnected identity ecosystems.[^fiesler] Biometric authentication—including facial recognition, fingerprint scanning, and voice identification—has transformed how we verify identity in digital spaces. Meanwhile, blockchain technology offers new paradigms for self-sovereign identity systems where users maintain greater control over their digital identifiers and credentials.[^allen]

Identity management also encompasses the management of [digital reputation](#online-reputation) and [personal branding](#personal-branding) across social media platforms, where users cultivate specific personas for different audiences. The concept of "context collapse"—where distinct social contexts converge in single platforms—has made identity management increasingly complex for everyday users.[^marwick]

Several examples illustrate the evolution and importance of identity management in new media:

* **OAuth and OpenID Connect**: These open protocols enable secure authorization between services without sharing password credentials, allowing for federated identity systems across the web.

* **Password Managers**: Applications like [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/), [1Password](https://1password.com/), and [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) help users generate, store, and manage complex passwords across multiple platforms, addressing the "password fatigue" problem.

* **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: This security process requires users to provide two different authentication factors, significantly enhancing security beyond password-only systems.

* **Self-Sovereign Identity Systems**: Blockchain-based initiatives like [Sovrin](https://sovrin.org/) and [uPort](https://www.uport.me/) aim to give individuals control over their digital identities without relying on centralized authorities.

* **GDPR and Identity Regulations**: Legislation like the European Union's [General Data Protection Regulation](https://gdpr.eu/) establishes rights regarding personal data, including the "right to be forgotten," directly impacting how digital identities are managed.

While identity management as a practice existed in various forms previously, the term "identity management" in its current technological context emerged in the late 1990s within enterprise IT. The concept was formalized and popularized by various industry groups and vendors developing directory services and access management solutions.

Kim Cameron, Microsoft's former Chief Architect of Identity, made significant contributions to identity management theory with his "Seven Laws of Identity" published in 2005, which established core principles for digital identity systems.[^cameron] The subsequent development of the Identity Metasystem concept helped shape modern approaches to federated identity.

The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS) have played crucial roles in developing standards like SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) and XACML (eXtensible Access Control Markup Language) that underpin modern identity management systems.
