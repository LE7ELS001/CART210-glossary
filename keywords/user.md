## User

A user is an individual who interacts with products, systems, or platforms not just for their basic functions but as part of their broader activities, goals, and experiences. Users bring their own preferences, histories, and lifestyles into their interactions with technology, shaping how they evaluate, use, and even inspire the development of new products or features. Their needs, perspectives, and the context in which they use technology play a key role in shaping digital tools and their evolution.[^margolin97user]

In the digital world, users do more than passively consume content—they actively engage with platforms, tools, and media. They create, share, and interact with digital content, influencing trends, brands, and the way media is consumed. This participatory role is a key aspect of the user reflects a change in power dynamics, where users shape content consumption patterns, influence advertising strategies, and redefine the digital ecosystem.[^rashtchy07user]

Users contribute content through photos, posts, and comments while also generating data through actions like clicking, tagging, and networking. However, they often have little control or awareness over how their contributions and personal data are collected and used by technology companies, often for commercial purposes.[^reyman13user]

Beyond content creation, users play a key role in shaping the systems they interact with. Their feedback and satisfaction influence how applications, platforms, and tools evolve. The way users engage with a system—based on their expectations, experiences, and needs—drives improvements and updates. This continuous feedback loop helps refine technology to better match user behaviors and demands. While measuring user satisfaction can be complex, understanding how users interact with systems is essential for creating more effective and user-friendly applications.[^etezadi91user]
