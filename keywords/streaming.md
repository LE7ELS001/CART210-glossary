Streaming is a term used to describe the transmission of data across multiple networks on a given device or [computer](../main/glossary.md#computer). The idea of streaming was first seen within the novel *Looking Backward* by Edward Bellamy. It presents a "music room" where music is transfered and transported by phone lines seamlessly into every home.[^harvey14station]

Nowadays, streaming takes on multiple forms, including music, video, live, and on-demand. Streaming websites such as YouTube and Twitch have blown up in popularity, and the entertainment and movie industry has also followed suit, with large corporations such as Netflix and Disney resorting to the creation of streaming services for the general public to use to engage with their movies or TV series.[^fagerjord19mapping] 

Streaming has transformed the landscape of the digital realm. It allows easy and quick accessibility for new media consumers of all types, ranging from music to TV. In fact, streaming services have displaced physical sales and digital downloads as the largest source of commercial music revenue in the US.[^chen17customer]
