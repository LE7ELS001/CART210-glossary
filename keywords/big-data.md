## Big Data

"Big data" is a term refering to large datasets. The term was coined in the mid 1990s, and is often attributed to Doug Mashey who was chief scientist at Silicon Graphic, Inc. 

Big Data is often characterized by the "threee V's": Volume, Velocity, and Variety. Volume refering to the large size of the datasets, velocity for the speed that the data is produced and analyzed, and variety refering to the differences of files and types of data. [^gregersen25bigdata]

In terms of New Media, Big Data can be useful in optimal usage of resources while making informed decisions [^allam19aismartcities]. "The analysis of Big Data can be done through Artificial Intelligence; which can be interpreted as the way of training computers to mimic thinking patterns and can even be done to simulate human behaviours". Most modern technology platforms have adapated big data to improve the "quality of life" for their services. 

Google's algorithm stores and predicts data for each one of it's users, such as their gender, age, ethnicity, location, etc. It then uses this data to recommend the user results that it thinks will align with their biases [^grind19googlealgo]. For example, if you were to search for news in a republican state in the USA, it would probably bring up something like Fox News. Here in Canada, the latest search for news brings up CTV, since Fox News is pretty irrelevant for users here. All of this algorithm is trained on big data, so that every user can have their own personalized experience based on machine learned biases.
