## Net Neutrality

Net neutrality is the principle that all data on the internet should be treated equally by internet service providers (ISPs), without discrimination or preferential treatment based on the type of content, user, website, or platform. [^wu03discrimination] It ensures that ISPs cannot block, throttle, or prioritize certain types of internet traffic, maintaining an open and level playing field for all online activities.

### Significance
Net neutrality is a cornerstone of digital democracy and innovation in new media. It ensures that the internet remains a public resource where users have equal access to information and services, fostering creativity, competition, and free expression. [^kimball22battle] Without net neutrality, ISPs could control what users see and do online, potentially stifling innovation and limiting access to diverse viewpoints. [^mcchesney13disconnect]
However, the debate over net neutrality also highlights tensions between corporate power, government regulation, and public interest. As Danny Kimball notes in Net Neutrality and the Battle for the Open Internet, the fight for net neutrality is not just about technical regulations but about preserving the internet as a space for democratic discourse and cultural production.

### Relation to Current Technologies and Media Practices
Net neutrality is deeply intertwined with contemporary digital technologies and practices:
- **Streaming Services:** Without net neutrality, ISPs could throttle streaming platforms like Netflix or YouTube, forcing them to pay for faster access or degrading their performance. [^wu03discrimination]
- **Emerging Technologies:** Technologies like 5G, IoT (Internet of Things), and cloud computing rely on an open internet to function effectively. Net neutrality ensures that these innovations are not hindered by ISP interference. [^schewick10internet]
- **Social Media and Content Creation:** Platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube depend on equal access to bandwidth. Without net neutrality, ISPs could prioritize their own content or charge creators for faster upload speeds, disadvantaging smaller creators. [^kimball22battle]

### Historical Origins
The concept of net neutrality is rooted in the design principles of the early internet and the regulatory traditions of telecommunications:
- **End-to-End Principle:** The internet was built on the end-to-end principle, which emphasizes that intelligence and functionality should reside at the edges of the network (users and applications) rather than in the core (ISPs). This principle, as explained by Barbara van Schewick in Internet Architecture and Innovation, ensures that the network remains neutral, allowing for permissionless innovation and equal access for all users. [^kimball22battle]
- **Common Carrier Tradition:** The idea of treating all data equally draws from the common carrier principle in telecommunications, which required phone companies to treat all calls equally without discrimination. This tradition influenced early debates about how broadband internet should be regulated. [^wu03discrimination]

The term "net neutrality" itself emerged in the early 2000s as broadband internet became more widespread, and concerns grew about ISPs potentially abusing their control over infrastructure to discriminate against certain types of traffic. [^schewick10internet]

### Key Figures
- **Tim Wu:** He coined the term "net neutrality" in his 2003 paper "Network Neutrality, Broadband Discrimination." Wu argued that ISPs should not be allowed to discriminate between different types of internet traffic, drawing parallels to the common carrier principle in telecommunications. His work laid the theoretical foundation for net neutrality advocacy. [^wu03discrimination]
- **Barbara van Schewick:** A leading scholar on internet architecture, van Schewick’s book *Internet Architecture and Innovation* provides a detailed analysis of how the internet’s design fosters innovation and why net neutrality is essential to maintaining this ecosystem. [^schewick10internet]
- **Free Press:** A media advocacy group that played a pivotal role in mobilizing public support for net neutrality through campaigns like Save the Internet. Their efforts were instrumental in shaping the public discourse around net neutrality and pushing for regulatory action.
- **FCC and Tom Wheeler:** The Federal Communications Commission, under Chairman Tom Wheeler, led the effort to reclassify broadband under Title II of the Communications Act in 2015, enabling the enforcement of net neutrality rules. This decision marked a significant victory for net neutrality advocates. [^mcchesney13disconnect]

### Influence on Contemporary Digital Culture and Society
Net neutrality has profound implications for digital culture and society:
- **Democracy and Free Expression:** An open internet ensures that diverse voices can be heard, fostering democratic discourse and cultural diversity. [^mcchesney13disconnect]
- **Economic Innovation:** By preventing ISPs from picking winners and losers, net neutrality allows startups and small businesses to compete on equal footing with established players. [^schewick10internet]
- **Global Impact:** The principles of net neutrality have influenced internet governance debates worldwide, with countries like India and the European Union adopting their own net neutrality regulations. [^kimball22battle]
