## Interactivity

Interactivity is a broad term within new media, one that was popuralized in the late 20th century as a machine's ability to respond to user input. It came to fashion as a way to describe human computer interaction (a relationship between a human and computer),
as opposed to how it was typically defined within sociology (a relationship between two people). This became especially prevalent as computers left the sphere of specialized scientific research, and became a household machine in the 80s.[^Quiring08interactivity] 
Since the term originated in sociology, it is hard to determine a single person or group who originally defined it within the context of new media.

Within digital Interactivity, there are two types: user-to-user interaction (ex. chat rooms, multi-player games) and user-to-system interaction (ex. writing an essay, single player games). There are also three basic dimensions to interactivity:[^Quiring08interactivity] 

1. ### As an attribute of technological systems
   Features that offer a potential for interaction, like hyperlinks.
   
2. ### As an attirbute of user perception
   The user realizing the "interactive potential" of the first dimension, by using said hyperlinks.
   
3. ### As an attribute of communication processes
   When the user achieves the second dimension and uses it properly, communication processes become interactive. For example, said hyperlink allows the user to send an email to someone, and that person responds to said email.

However, some researchers argue that we have not yet grasped what interactivity is, what it does, or its consequences on members of a social system.[^Bucy04society] They believe that beyond just being a technical property of media systems, it must have meaningful social relevance as a concept; and that different interactive technologies should not be classified as they exist within an unbiased theoretical framework.

The purpose of interactivity within our contemporary understanding is strongly linked to that of media richness theory. Proposed in 1986 by Richard Daft and Robert Lengel, it refers to the “ability of information to change understanding within a time interval”.[^Daft86richness] The theory proposes that different forms of media have different levels of communicational "richness", with face-to-face communication being the richest possible form. By imitating face-to-face communication, it is proposed that digital interactivity becomes more communicationally rich.[^Quiring08interactivity] Hence why interactive media is in an arms race to emulate real-world interaction, especially nowadays with AI chatbots or customer support alogorithms.
