## Software

Various software have become an indispensable factor of our everyday lives, being the driving force behind everything from how we communicate to how one may monitor their fitness progress. ‘Software’ itself refers to the general concept of operating information that a computer may use in order to execute tasks, such as computer programs. Some examples include databases like Microsoft SQL or Oracle Database, search engines like Google Chrome or Explorer and word processors including Microsoft Word. However, it is often easy to think of ‘software’ as a product that is simply meant to be bought and used when “With Microsoft’s rise to dominance in the software industry, it’s easy to think of software primarily as a product, something that is developed, packaged, and sold.In fact, shrinkwrapped PC applications represent only a small fraction of the total software in use,” [^OReilly34]. Open-source softwares are an incredibly significant portion of the software industry, as they allow for experimentation and collaboration between software engineers that can lead to important developments in order to keep up with our ever-quickening technological world. Barry Boehm states that these developments are ever increasing both due to “Gordon Moore’s Law (transistor and integrated circuit density and performance doubles roughly every 18 months), plus the continuing need for product differentiation and tornado like processes for new technology introduction [Geoffrey Moore, 1995]. Global connectivity also accelerates the ripple effects of technology, marketplace, and technology changes” [^Boehm5]. Moreover, there are far more areas of software development that are affected by technological advancements in order to keep up. As Meir Lehman and Juan C. Fernandez-Ramil explain in  Software Evolution and Feedback: Theory and Practice “Evolution phenomena in software-related domains are not confined to programs and related artefacts such as specifications, designs and documentation. Applications, definitions, goals, paradigms, algorithms, languages, usage practices, the sub-processes and processes of software evolution and so on, also evolve” [^LehmanRamil14]. In order for software developers to keep up with our rapidly developing world, it is important to understand the various influences and considerations that go into producing an effective software product.
