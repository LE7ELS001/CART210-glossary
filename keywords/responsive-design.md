## Responsive Design

Responsive design is also known as Responsive Web Design (RWD). It is a web design technique to apply to websites to make them scalable and accessible for multiple devices. This allows developers to make website content adaptable for all screen sizes. 
The technique automatically adjusts the components displayed on the web page to the screen size. The term Responsive design was coined by web developer Ethan Marcotte in 2010[^GardnerRWD], he believed that a webpage should satisfy all users’ needs by having the pages adjust to their users. He published an article where he stated the top three important factors in creating a scalable website are flexible images, fluid grids and media queries[^NebelingRWD]. Responsive web design is applied through HTML5 and CSS3 web development languages. Flexible images that are either scalable on their own or they resize. A fluid layout utilizes a scalable grid layout to be resized based on the user’s screen size. Media queries allow the website to know which CSS3 properties it should apply to elements when the screen is resized. 


Responsive design helps users have a seamless browsing experience on a web page. This practice prioritizes user experience by changing the placements of elements on a webpage in response to the screen size. It remains a very accessible and usability-friendly practice. Responsiveness enforces affordance practices by allowing users to view the same website on different devices and still perform intended actions through different approaches. Responsive web design optimizes the user experience [^W3SchoolsRWD].
The RWD technique is innovative and has changed the history of web development for the better. 

Most websites hosted online follow responsive design best practices. Here are two examples: https://github.com and https://google.com.
