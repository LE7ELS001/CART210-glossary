## Internet of Things (IoT)

The Internet of Things (IoT), sometimes referred to as the Internet of Objects.[^zeinab17IoTapplications] It refers to a network of physical objects embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies that enable them to connect and exchange data over the internet.[^rose15IoToverview] These objects, often called "smart devices," range from everyday consumer products like smart thermostats and wearable fitness trackers to industrial machines and urban infrastructure components.

The term "Internet of Things" was coined by Kevin Ashton in 1999.[^li15IoTsurvey] He described it as a system of interconnected objects that use radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology for communication.[^li15IoTsurvey] The terms "Internet" and "Things" refer to a globally interconnected network driven by sensory, communication, networking, and information processing technologies, which have redefined the concept of information and communications technology (ICT).[^li15IoTsurvey] IoT operates through four primary communication models that define how devices interact: Device-to-Device Communication, Device-to-Cloud Communication, Device-to-Gateway Model, and Back-End Data-Sharing Model.[^rose15IoToverview] These models enable IoT devices to collect large amounts of data, analyze inputs, and respond accurately and efficiently. A key advantage of IoT technology is its cost-effectiveness and low complexity, which contribute to reducing localization errors and improving real-time data processing.[^xia12IoT]

IoT has been widely adopted across various fields, including supply chain management, manufacturing, environmental monitoring, retail, smart shelf operations, healthcare, the food and restaurant industry, and travel and tourism.[^li15IoTsurvey] The IoT is expected to significantly contribute to addressing social challenges such as healthcare monitoring, daily life assistance, and traffic congestion management.[^li15IoTsurvey] Such that, both consumers and manufacturers could be benefit from IoT's hardware and software components as enhance lifestyle and efficiency.

The products of IoT like Internet-enabled appliances, home automation components, and energy management systems are advancing the concept of the "smart home” .[^zeinab17IoTapplications][^rose15IoToverview] While on a societal level, IoT improves infrastructure, enhances public transportation, reduces traffic congestion, and fosters safer and more engaged communities, which contributing to the development of "smart cities".[^zeinab17IoTapplications][^rose15IoToverview]  Moreover, IoT is transforming digital media by enabling seamless real-time data exchange, personalized content delivery, and interactive experiences across connected platforms, influencing entertainment, communication, and media consumption patterns.[^hallur21entertainment]

For example:
- Smart Homes: Users can control lighting, TVs, air conditioning, and central heating through mobile apps and smart home assistants like Amazon Alexa and Google Home.
- Smart Cities: Citizens can access real-time transportation and weather updates through IoT-connected apps that gather data from sensors across urban areas.
- Healthcare: IoT devices such as wearable fitness trackers and health monitoring tools, like the Apple Watch and Enflux Smart Clothing, provide users with personalized health insights and enable medical devices to deliver more precise and effective care.[^zeinab17IoTapplications]
- Entertainment: IoT has transformed entertainment experiences through smart TVs, streaming devices, and voice-controlled assistants that personalize media consumption. While VR headsets and IoT-connected gaming systems create immersive, real-time interactive experiences.[^hallur21entertainment]

Despite its advantages, IoT raises significant concerns regarding data privacy and security. Since IoT devices collect and analyze vast amounts of personal data, issues related to data flow security and user rights have become major challenges in IoT development.[^rose15IoToverview] The rapid evolution of IoT often outpaces the ability of legal, policy, and regulatory frameworks to keep up,[^rose15IoToverview] which making it difficult for governments and global institutions to establish universally accepted regulations. Addressing these concerns will be critical to ensuring IoT's continued growth while safeguarding user privacy and security.
