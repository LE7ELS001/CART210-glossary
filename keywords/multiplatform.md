## Multiplatform

Multiplatform is a term used to describe cross compatibility with multiple devices. Within a new media context, this refers to software that is able to run on multiple different devices, for example Windows, iOS, Android and [Linux](../main/glossary.md#Linux) are all forms of software that are able to run on different forms of [hardware](../main/glossary.md#hardware), such as [computers](../main/glossary.md#computer) and phones. Multiplatform consumption has been around for decades, when people used to use radio as background noise for when they were reading the newspaper or magazines.[^chan18consumption]

The usage of multiplatform environments have greatly increased the diversity of content that has been distributed as well as the volume of content that is presently available.[^champion15diversity] Currently, we are able to access a plethora of content and media due to multiplatform compatibility. More content is being distributed across multiplatform channels and software due to the fact that many people have different means of access points and different modes of technology.

Due to the fact that modern technologies are constantly improving, there is a necessity for multiplatform softwares, such as with mobile devices, where there are differing and multiple types of mobile phones and tablets. Each operating platform within a mobile device requires separate standards, programming languages and distribution markets, which poses a challenge on software developers.[^corral12mobile] Thus, is it crucial to have a multiplatform software that allows for developers to be able to extend their reach towards different users.
