## Creative Commons

  Creative commons was crafted by a law professor at Stanford University named Lawrence Lessig and others which aren't mentioned by name in December
  of 2002 which provides a set of copyright licenses which is free for public use. A website was created called Creative Commons (creativecommons.org) where a creator who wants to publish their work can select what license they want to use
  and she can chose to retain her copyright of her work but allow other people to use her work without permission and without payment as long as they credit her for the original work. [^Kim]

  A study was created to examine whether Creative Commons can resolve the conflict surrounding copyright laws in the digital era.
  there's further explanation of the study as "that framework posits that there are two competing visions of the fundamentals of copyright law: a "private property" vision and a "public property vision.""[^Kim] When it comes to private property vision
  is the belief that artist should have full ownership over their work and that its the private interest of authors who created original works deserve to have property rights over their work. As for public property vision is that "those who note that copyright has historically developed as society's grant of a limited 
  monopoly and who think that the rights of authors must be weighted against the freedom of everyone else to use the copyrighted work."[^Kim] The role of copyright as a matter of public policy that aims to achieve a balance between private interests and public interests.

  *What is Creative Commons?*
  
  Creative Commons is a "suite of copyright-based licenses defining terms for the distribution and re-use of creative works." [^Hagedorn,Mietchen,Morris,Agosti,Penev,Berendsohn,Hobern] Creative Commons provides licenses for different use cases and includes open content license such as the Attribution License (e.g. CC BY, used by many open access scientific publishers), and the Attribution Share Alike license(CC BY-SA which is used by Wikipedia). 
  The license suite also contains non-free and non-open lcienses like those containing a "non-commercial" which in short is referred to as NC condition. When providing background information from studies created by professors, CC licenses in general, and how there are advantages, disadvantages.

  *Creative Commons and New Media*

  When it comes to Creative Commons in New Media, institues have adopted Creative Commons Licenses for their content. For example, nphoto.net and bababian.com are both presenting their web pages with photographic works licensed under a local Creative Commons licensed and many more individual photographers are choosing CC as their licensing regimen of their choice. 
"Creative Commons licenses are commonly ised in new media and the internet. The internet media, for example social networking sites, user geenrated sites {...} all have distinct features such as openess, sharing, re-usability and unification of interests of authors and users."[^Wang]
And emphasizes that a participative culture or a 'read-write culture', as dinstiguished from the traditional 'read-only culture'.
Creative Commons has become an effective alternative to copyright. One of the impportant aims of CC is "to build a free and extensive infrastructure at the content layer that enables freedoms that many different Web 2.0 creative projects require."[^Wang]
