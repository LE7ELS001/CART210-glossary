## Hardware 

Hardware can be defined as “the physical and electronic parts of a computer” as opposed to the “instructions it follows” which is also known as software. [^cambridge] 

Hardware can appear in many forms and devices. More notably, in a computer, the most common pieces are the motherboard, the central processing unit (CPU), the random-access memory (RAM), 
storage drives such as a hard drive (HDD) or solid-state drive (SSD), the graphics processing unit (GPU), power supply unit (PSU), heat sinks or fans, the protective case, and many more. [^crucial] [^Jerome15]

As computers became more and more popular, so have the rise in the manufacturing of hardware parts across the world. 
As such, there was a need to set standards for compatibility purposes but also to protect against counterfeit components. [^Guin19]
These counterfeit hardware devices can be categorized into different types: recycled, remarked, overproduced, defective, cloned, forged documentation, or tampered. [^Guin19]

Considering how hardware is not a single entity, the first piece of hardware cannot be attributed to just one component. 
Instead, we can give credit to some of the first types of hardware such as the “first computer mouse that was invented in 1963 by Douglas Engelbart”, 
or the first RAM which was attributed to An Wang and Jay Forrester in 1951. [^Pingdom19]

As for the word itself, the earliest known usage dates back to 1419 according to Oxford English Dictionary. [^oxford].
Hardware relates heavily to modern technologies as it is present in every piece of technology that we use such as phones, computers, and servers, which enables us to share information and media around the world.
With artificial intelligence getting more and more advanced, it will also require new hardware developed to be able to handle its power. 
Fortunately, tech companies such as NVIDIA and Intel are actively producing new components that are being tested with AI. [^Sipola22]
