## Geotagging

**Geotagging** is a technology that involves attributing geolocational information to different forms of media[^longley-geographic]. This is done by gathering the data through a devices positional services and storing it in the medias metadata. Geotagging started taking prominence in the early to mid 2000s with the rise of cell phones due to their photo-taking abilities and integrated GPSs. 


Social media services were some of the first to adopt the technology. Though it took some time, these services allowed users to share both pictures and their locations with additional visualization as seen with [Snapchat](https://www.snapchat.com/). Geotagging has also been widely used in specific scientific fields, where researchers use it to more easily catalogue massive amounts of information. [^nowak-natural] 


Due to the additional data, many privacy experts have warned about the increased use of geotagging. This includes a short period in time where celebrities would unknowingly publicize the location of their home by sharing pictures online.[^abc-celbrities] Geotagging is a feature that is automatically enabled on most devices in the present day, but users are unlikely warned.[^lipschultz-social] This means most users are providing sensitive information for their digital footprint without notice, increasing their digital vulnerability.
