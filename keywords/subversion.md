## Subversion

Subversion in thought and action and technical choice in New Media, refers to the intention to undermine, challenge or question established structures, dogmas or conventions in the field and in society. Just like in any art form or knowledge production strategy, it may become necessary to employ the use of subversion as an attempt to sabotage, derail and refocus collective conversations around social justice, oppression and the erasure of marginalized voices, and to affect the material conditions conducive for action towards liberation and a new non-exploitative technological paradigm.
Such employment of the technique, manifested as blasphemous, provocative, profane, satirical, ironic, questioning, combative or simply alternate and divergent language and style, is the defining quality of such works and articulations as Donna Harrawayâ€™s Cyborg Manifesto[^Harraway], The VNS Matrix Cyberfeminist Manifesto[^VNS], and the vast array of resources available on The Anarchist Library[^AnLi].
