## FinTech

FinTech stands for "financial technology" and refers to the use of technology to help the efficiency and accessibility of financial institutions. Cryptocurrency is a leading aspect of the concept, but so are online banking and online lending platforms.[^schueffel]
FinTech has reshaped financial interactions within digital spaces. It has redefined how people handle transactions, shifting from physical cash exchanges to contactless payments, mobile wallets, and decentralized currencies. This transformation has democratized access to financial services, allowing many individuals with internet access and smart devices to participate in those technologies.[^arner] However, the move towards cash-free economies has raised concerns regarding financial exclusion, particularly for vulnerable individuals who rely on physical currency to get by.
Many technological inventions have affected FinTech. For example, artificial intelligence makes automated investment tactics possible with AI advisors. In addition, new data analytics provide credit scoring and risk assessment. Blockchain technology offers a new, decentralized way to complete transactions. These technologies all add to the emergent FinTech world and are also changing wider digital culture. Many conversations regarding cryptocurrency, decentralized banking, and economic independence are spreading on social media[^zohar]. Many platforms are also now looking to incorporate FinTech within their features.
Being a rapidly growing phenomenon, many prominent examples of FinTech exist. As previously mentioned, mobile payment services like PayPal and Apple Pay have revolutionized consumer spending habits. Many transactions have shifted to an online format. Decentralized currencies powered by blockchain technology have also changed how people invest and exchange money. The 'Bitcoin boom' has especially disrupted conventional notions of currency and investment, becoming a trending topic worldwide.[^Nakamoto]
The term "FinTech" gained momentum in the early 1990s when Citicorp pioneered the Financial Services Technology Consortium, but gained popular usage in the 2010s when tech companies and startups began to change established financial service business models. Scholars such as Douglas Arner have examined its evolution, noting its phases of development from early financial digitalization to contemporary blockchain-based systems.[^arner] The impact of FinTech continues to evolve, with debates in relation to its impact on financial access, security, and regulatory concerns.
