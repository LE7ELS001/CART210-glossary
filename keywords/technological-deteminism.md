## Technological Determinism

Technological determinism is the idea that society's transformation is heralded by technological innovation. In more detailed terms, the belief that any social change is determined by technological development, communications,
media etc, forming a very convenient "before and after" narrative structure.[^Smith94dilemma]
The term is widely thought to be coined by sociologist Thorstein Veblen, as a link between technology and society. 
However, an antithetical belief called social determinism argues that instead, it is technology that is influenced by social changes. Some also argue that both may be influencing one another with a mutual "push and pull",
where societyis formed by the technological change, and the technological change is then shaped by the society.[^Hauer17newmedia]

A pertinent theoretical example of technological determinism comes in the form of Christopher Columbus, adding to the "collective western lore" of deterministic narrative structure. For the better part of modern history, Europe had no knowledge on the "new world", until the invention of the compass, which allowed Columbus to colonize the new world.
Afterwards, new navigational equipment is invented as a result of the successful colonization, as a "precondition". Because of the inherent tangibility (and lack of abstraction) of historical technology, a certain efficacy is artificially formed within the memory of history that places emphasis on the consequences of the object.[^Smith94dilemma]

A subsection of the theory dictates that the consequences of technology are the result of poor use from people, as opposed to the nature of technological development. American writer Alvin Toffler described the age we live in as as a "third wave"
in which the continuous automation and development of technology has led to the acceleration of life's pace, leading to a major impact on the psyche of humans.[^Hauer17newmedia]
