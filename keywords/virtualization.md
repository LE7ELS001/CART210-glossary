## Virtualization

Virtualization is the process of creating a software-based representation of physical computing resources, enabling multiple virtual systems to operate simultaneously on a single hardware device. This technology essentially decouples hardware from software, allowing resources to be abstracted, shared, and allocated more efficiently[^1].

Virtualization is significant in new media because it restructures how computing infrastructure is managed and utilized. By separating software from hardware dependencies, virtualization enables flexibility in terms of resource allocation and system management. This abstraction layer transforms computing resources into scalable, portable utilities that can be provisioned on demand[^2].

In current media practices, virtualization serves as the foundational technology underlying cloud computing, allowing for dynamic scaling of resources across data centers. It enables content delivery networks, streaming services, and digital media platforms to efficiently distribute computational resources according to demand. Virtualization also facilitates software development by allowing programmers to test applications across multiple operating systems simultaneously[^3].

Some real world examples include desktop virtualization (enabling remote access to personalized workspaces), and network virtualization (creating segmented virtual networks on shared physical infrastructure). These implementations demonstrate how virtualization optimizes resources while improving reliability and availability[^1].

The concept of virtualization dates back to the 1960s when IBM developed CP/CMS (Control Program/Cambridge Monitor System), which evolved into VM/370, allowing multiple users to run seemingly isolated systems on shared mainframe hardware. However, the modern resurgence of virtualization is largely attributed to VMware's founding in 1998, which popularized virtualization for commodity x86 hardware[^2].
