## API

API short for Application Programming Interface is described as an "interface that is defined in terms of a set of functions and procedures and enables a program [...] within an application."[^simon] Simon and Jean explain how using an API allows existing or new business capability from across a network with it being an on-demand service for usage from multitudes of applications and software.

API are varied and have different concepts to it, in the text “A Systematic Review of API Evolution Literature” as an example “when the concept of information was first coined by Parnas in 1972, it was based on interfaces among modules, which today would be called API’s” [^Lamothe]

API is valuable for business due to its ability to connect many people to communicate and share data with each other with ease. The book "API Architecture" explains very clearly how "Now, think about these entities that are run by software. Industrial production processes are controlled by software. Machines, cars and many consumer products contain software.[...] APIs provide a possibility to connect these separate software entities"[^Biehl] and with the use of APIs, it allows it to connect between separate software entities.

An API when it comes to new media is significant as it can allow the user to be able to reach a lot of people across the world when the API is used by other people through the internet. When it comes new media, if an artist wants to reach more people to view and support their work, they will purchase and use an API service to reach other people globally.
