## Training  

Training is the process of developing skills or abilities to improve performance for tasks. It can be both formal and informal, and take place in almost any setting, like in an educational or personal environment. Training is very important for most professional level jobs, athletic performances, and for skill requiring activities, and training allows people to change their ways to be able to use the newer technology or challenges that are required in their life. In the field of new media, training has a major role in building up a digital artist and designer’s skills that are needed for their job or passion during this time of new emerging AI tools and platforms. With these fast evolutions of technologies, constant training makes sure that professionals can stay up to date in a competitive industry[^1].  

Training can take many forms, here are some examples:

- **Online Courses and Tutorials**: Platforms like Coursera, Udemy, and LinkedIn Learning provide courses on digital design, coding, and multimedia production[^2].  
- **Workshops and Bootcamps**: Intensive, hands-on training sessions help people develop practical skills in areas like UX/UI design, game development, and digital storytelling.  
- **Corporate Training Programs**: Many tech companies invest in employee training to keep teams updated on the latest advancements in AI, cybersecurity, and digital marketing[^3].  
- **Interactive Learning Through AI and VR**: AI tutors and VR simulations offer new ways to make training more immersive and personalized.  

The idea of a structured training plan has its history rooted from the idea of apprenticeships, where people would learn trades through hands-on experience under the guidance of a master. In modern times, training has been implemented more into more formal settings, like in the education system and in corporations.[^4] The increase of online learning has made training more accessible, and has allowed for people to learn globally and to acquire specific skills from anywhere in the world. Training has made a change to digital culture by how it has given a huge amount of online resources to people, which made the idea of being a self taught worker feasible and made way for them to reshape the normal ways of making a career for themselves. But the digital divide is a concern because the access to quality training depends on whether the internet has unbiased available training and if they cost a lot of money or not.
